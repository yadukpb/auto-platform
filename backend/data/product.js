    description:
      "It's a lot more than just a hopped up Huracan as some internet comments will lead you to believe. The face, tail and even the sides are choc-a-bloc with sharp edges and creases and the production version is actually more aggressively styled than the concept.The interiors of the Urus are stunning to say the least with mix of Hexagons and Octagons jumping out at you. After climbing in and sitting down in this tall SUV you are greeted with a modern cockpit styled layout. This is further emphasized by the gear/drive mode console selector which is designed like the throttle of an aircraft. Even though when you break down the parts into bits you will find a lot borrowed from Audi's sedan range the Lambo cabin still manages to deliver the drama which starts from the moment when you reach for the start flip open the red cover and thumb the starter.",

    description:
      "Even though it looks quite conventional, what lies beneath Tesla’s flagship sedan is anything but. At the front, the minimalistic bumper design and the T-shaped grille flanked by stylish LED headlamp enclosures give the Model S a distinctive face. From the side, the Tesla’s silhouette resembles a coupe more than a three-box sedan. The standard 10-spoke, 19-inch wheels accentuate the sporty quotient further. The 10-spoke, 20-inch wheels are available as optional extras. The tailgate is like that of a hatchback, and opens wide and tall along with the rear windshield. The reason why the design is so in-tune with the times is to make the four-door saloon more acceptable to the masses.Yes, there is a circular steering wheel and there are seats to carry five passengers. But that’s where similarities between the Model S and saloons from any other manufacturer end. Two digital screens control and display every information relating to the car. The first screen acts as the instrument cluster while the larger 17-inch touchscreen display on the centre console relays information such as battery charge, energy consumption, sat-nav. It also displays the controls for the sound system, AC, sunroof and demister. The interior upholstery looks classy and understated at the same time. The real kicker is the massive cargo volume. The Tesla Model S has two boots - one under the bonnet and the other behind the rear seats. The cumulative volume stands at over 802-litres (over 1,704-litres with the rear seats folded).",
